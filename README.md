# fitts

Research project to help improve the accuracy and efficiency of the clicking method within the Camera Mouse interface.

Analyze.java takes in movement records from users, to predict a target location using reverse Fittsâ€™s law (Instead of finding the distance between
point A and B, we start at point A and use an average distance moved using point A as starting point to predict point B)


A statistical analysis was condcted using Python, which proved that this procedure is 13% more accurate than existing clocking methods for
the camera moude.
